<h3>Solo Travel India: Everything You Need to Know Before You Go

</h3>
<p>
We all travel at different times, for different reasons. We travel to discover parts of ourselves, parts of the earth, to meet new people, places and things and India is a destination that covers all these categories. Long seen as a haven for hippies and backpackers, the country’s social inequality often makes travellers hesitant about visiting the subcontinent.
<br><br>
India is the ultimate country for discovery though, be it through the maze of the country’s major cities or the peace and tranquillity that can be found the more remote regions. It’s this sense of discovery that makes India so perfect for those wanting to travel by themselves and while there are some precautions that you should take, travel to India can be affordable, accessible and safe, if you plan well.
<br><br>
We’ve put together our top tips for travelling alone around India to help take the stress out of your travel planning and to help you plan all that you want to discover.
<br><br>
Before you go
<br><br><br><br>
As with most trips the more you plan in advance, the easier your holiday will be, in particular if you plan on doing a lot of travel within India or will be away for an extended period of time. There are a couple of no-brainers with this kind of trip, but you would be amazed how many people ignore them, namely get your visa (if required) before you go, get your vaccines from your local GP or tropical medicine bureau and buy travel insurance.
<br><br>
The next thing is to give yourself the time and flexibility within your itinerary. Often travellers try to cram in far too much into their trip to India, but it’s not the sort of country that can be taken at a whistle-stop pace. The best bet is to pick a region to explore rather than criss-crossing the country all at once.
